# Image Classification with CNN

## Data

Worldwide 300,000 people are diagnosed with brain tumors annually.


```{r}
library(keras)
library(tensorflow)

batch_size <- 32
img_height <- 256
img_width <- 256
#increases resolution, helps model generalize

# Define class names
class_names <- c('notumor', 'pituitary', 'meningioma', 'glioma')

# Normalizes pixel values to [0,1]
train_gen <- image_data_generator(rescale = 1/255, validation_split = 0.2)  # Include validation split
test_gen <- image_data_generator(rescale = 1/255)

#validation splits helps with over fitting, noticed the model before the split had a high accuracy 
# but low validation accuracy which told us the model was overfitting.

# Train dataset (80% of the training data)
train_dataset <- flow_images_from_directory( #loads and processes images from directory
  directory = "data/Training",
  generator = train_gen,
  target_size = c(img_height, img_width),
  batch_size = batch_size,
  class_mode = "categorical",
  subset = "training",  # Specify training subset
  seed = 1111
)

# Validation dataset (20% of the training data)
validation_dataset <- flow_images_from_directory(
  directory = "data/Training",
  generator = train_gen,
  target_size = c(img_height, img_width),
  batch_size = batch_size,
  class_mode = "categorical",
  subset = "validation",  # Specify validation subset, loads 20% for validation
  seed = 1111
)

# Test dataset, no splits
test_dataset <- flow_images_from_directory(
  directory = "data/Testing",
  generator = test_gen,
  target_size = c(img_height, img_width),
  batch_size = batch_size,
